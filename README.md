# Personal-Site
My personal site, now running WebAssembly!

Must have the Emscripten compiler suite installed to run. 

## Building
	* Run the Makefile to compile and open the html target 

## TODO 
	Implement realistic gravity... Right now just has a hard ceiling
	Not scaling on 4k monitor... investigate
